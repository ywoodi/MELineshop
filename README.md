As a little disclaimer: reloading a page isn't really meant to be happening, since the porject uses Vue's Client Site Routing, which isnt actually recognised by Github to be its own subpage! When finding yourself in a 404 Error Page by GitHub, consider reloading the Base URL of "https://ywoodi.github.io/MELineshop/" and starting over again!
